## Usage

![google-book-search-functionality-gif](/client/public/assets/images/google-books-search-and-save-gif.gif)
    
To use this app you will need to first install the dependencies using node.js. This app uses bootstrap and react-bootstrap for some of its components as well as axios for it api calls. For this app the user will be able to search for books by title and it will return a list of books from the google books api. Can click to view the information for their book as well as save the book information using a MongoDB database to view them later.

I would like to eventually include a way to add authentication so users can log in to view their personal information.
